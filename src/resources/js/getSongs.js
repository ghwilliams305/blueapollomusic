While holding people to high standards may seem noble, it's a perspective I've had to reevaluate. This introspective piece, set for brass sextet and piano, encapsulates the complexities of a relationship where expectations and reality collide. Amidst the brass ensemble's resounding melodies, this composition delves into the turmoil of unmet expectations and the internal struggle of reconciling disappointment with understanding.

        description: "This semester has been a bit hectic. Nothing I can't manage, but there have been a lot of late nights walking back to my dorm. Coming from the main campus, the inter-campus bus would stop me about ten minutes away from my dorm. From there, I would have to walk back in the dead of night. The moments walking back are some of my favorite, looking up and gazing at the stars and the moon. This piece, scored for a woodwind ensemble, is inspired by the moon piercing through the night clouds above, the clouds casting an ominous shadow in the moon's light. The song begins with my peaceful walk home before I look up and see the moon glaring down at me. The bassoon plays low, pungent eighth notes, the bass clarinet singing the low, ominous aura of the moon, and the high reeds fluttering over top. Eventually, I have to walk into my dorm, and the moon is covered by man-made walls. It doesn't end there, though; through my window, the moon watches over me as I sleep, refueling me for the next day. This piece is suitable for a woodwind ensemble, ideal for chamber music performances. The score is available on Musescore for those interested in sheet music inspired by the moon and the celestial beauty of the night sky.",
